# CTCN Capacity building workshop - Bangladesh 2023


![alt text](data/Picture13.png)


This repository contains training material that corresponds to the training manual provided. It is designed to introduce tools and analysis for monitoring coastal and riverine geomorphology in a region heavily impacted by climate change. The materials provide an introduction to Earth Observation (EO) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) through step-by-step workflows (notebooks) to provide insights through changes in surface water. It is a requirement that you have [signed up for GEE](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/) in order to follow the material provided.


The material is divided into 4 modules:
- Module 1: Introduction to GEE.
- Module 2: Surface water classification at scale. 
- Module 3: Timeseries analysis of river morphology and early warning identification.
- Module 4: Coastal analysis with tidal context. 


The work is sponsored by the UN Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN). The CTCN promotes the accelerated transfer of environmentally sound technologies for low carbon and climate resilient development at the request of developing countries. They provide technology solutions, capacity building and advice on policy, legal and regulatory frameworks tailored to the needs of individual countries.
